# Emotion Detection App

## Project Description (Objective)
This project is an emotion detection web application that leverages deep learning and computer vision to recognize human emotions from facial images. The objective is to provide real-time emotion analysis through a user-friendly web interface.

## Key Technologies Used
1.HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5  
2.XAMPP Server  
3.Deepface  
4.OpenCV  
5.Python (for backend/model handling)

## Key Features for End Users
1.Real-time emotion detection from uploaded images or webcam  
2.Interactive dashboard displaying emotion trends and statistics  
3.User registration and login for personalized experience  
4.Tracking and viewing personal emotion history and logs  
5.Visual analytics and charts for emotion data  
6.Secure account management and data privacy  
7.Display of most common emotion with percentage, recent detected emotion, and emotional progress percentage

## What Makes It Unique
1.Integration of Deepface and OpenCV for robust facial emotion recognition  
2.Customizable and extendable emotion categories  
3.User-friendly dashboard with visual analytics  
4.Modular codebase for easy experimentation and model updates

## Learning Outcomes
1.Gained hands-on experience with deep learning and computer vision libraries  
2.Learned to build full-stack web applications integrating Python backends with modern frontends  
3.Understood the challenges of real-world emotion recognition and dataset handling  
4.Improved skills in deploying and testing machine learning models

# Emotion Detection App

A full-stack web application for real-time facial emotion recognition using deep learning and computer vision. Built with Flask, OpenCV, Deepface, and a custom CNN, it supports live webcam analysis and interactive dashboards for emotion analytics. The modular backend enables rapid model experimentation, while the frontend offers dynamic charting and session logs. Designed for extensibility, the system integrates therapist feedback, supports custom emotion categories, and provides RESTful APIs for emotion data. Ideal for research, mental health, and advanced analytics.

# Real-Time Emotion Detection and Feedback System

This project is a Real-Time Emotion Detection and Feedback System built using Flask, OpenCV, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion modeling. The application allows users to register, track their emotions, and visualize emotional trends over time.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Real-time emotion detection using webcam
- Emotion tracking over time
- Visualization of emotional trends using charts
- User-friendly dashboard

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
	```
	git clone <repository-url>
	cd emotion-detection-app
	```

2. Install the required dependencies:
	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

3. Configure the database connection in `config.py`:
	- Update the database credentials as needed.

4. Run the application:
	```
	python app.py
	```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

- **Register**: Create a new account to start tracking your emotions.
- **Login**: Access your dashboard with your registered credentials.
- **Emotion Detection**: Use your webcam to detect emotions in real-time.
- **Track Emotions**: View your emotional history and trends over time.
