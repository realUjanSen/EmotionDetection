```bash
python -m venv .venv
# PowerShell: . .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# cmd: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Unix: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure `config.py` as needed (database, secrets).

4. Run the app:

```bash
cd emotion-detection-app
python app.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:5000
