# Emotion Detection App

## Project Description (Objective)
This project is an emotion detection web application that leverages deep learning and computer vision to recognize human emotions from facial images. The objective is to provide real-time emotion analysis through a user-friendly web interface.

## Key Technologies Used
1.HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5  
2.XAMPP Server  
3.Deepface  
4.OpenCV  
5.Python (for backend/model handling)

## Key Features for End Users
1.Real-time emotion detection from uploaded images or webcam  
2.Interactive dashboard displaying emotion trends and statistics  
3.User registration and login for personalized experience  
4.Tracking and viewing personal emotion history and logs  
5.Visual analytics and charts for emotion data  
6.Secure account management and data privacy  
7.Display of most common emotion with percentage, recent detected emotion, and emotional progress percentage

## What Makes It Unique
1.Integration of Deepface and OpenCV for robust facial emotion recognition  
2.Customizable and extendable emotion categories  
3.User-friendly dashboard with visual analytics  
4.Modular codebase for easy experimentation and model updates

## Learning Outcomes
1.Gained hands-on experience with deep learning and computer vision libraries  
2.Learned to build full-stack web applications integrating Python backends with modern frontends  
3.Understood the challenges of real-world emotion recognition and dataset handling  
4.Improved skills in deploying and testing machine learning models

## Future Goals
1.Expand emotion categories for more nuanced detection  
2.Integrate voice emotion analysis  
3.Deploy the application on cloud platforms for wider accessibility  
4.Add user authentication and data analytics features
