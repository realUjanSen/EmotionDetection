# Migration Instructions:
# 
# 1. **Setup**: Ensure that you have the necessary database and tables created as per the application's requirements.
# 
# 2. **Migration Tool**: Use a migration tool like Flask-Migrate or Alembic to manage database migrations. Install the required package via pip:
#    ```
#    pip install Flask-Migrate
#    ```
# 
# 3. **Initialize Migrations**: Run the following command to initialize migrations:
#    ```
#    flask db init
#    ```
# 
# 4. **Create Migration Scripts**: After making changes to your models, create a new migration script:
#    ```
#    flask db migrate -m "Description of changes"
#    ```
# 
# 5. **Apply Migrations**: Apply the migrations to your database:
#    ```
#    flask db upgrade
#    ```
# 
# 6. **Rollback Migrations**: If needed, you can rollback the last migration:
#    ```
#    flask db downgrade
#    ```
# 
# 7. **Version Control**: Keep your migration scripts under version control to track changes over time.
# 
# For more detailed information, refer to the documentation of the migration tool you are using.
